# Package xz

This Go language package will enable reading and writing of
xz-compressed files and streams. The complete package will be written in
Go and doesn't use any existing C library.

The package is currently under development. *You cannot use it even on
your own risk.*

# Progress

A simple encoder and decoder for the LZMA  format are working. These
streams must now be embedded in LZMA2 and the xz format.
