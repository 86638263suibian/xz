# xz

Native Go Language implementation of the xz LZMA2 compression.

This Go package is currently under development. You cannot use it even at your
own risk.

The classic LZMA decoder works now for the first example file.

## TODO

1. Support elegant way to keep to enable/disable debugging output on
   stderr.
2. Improve errors for errors in the input file.
