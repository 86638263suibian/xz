# Package xz

This Go language package will enable reading and writing of
xz-compressed files and streams. The complete package will be written in
Go and will not use any existing C library.

The package is currently under development. Don't expect the code to
work for you or the APIs to be stable.

# Status

Package xz/lzma has now working support for "classic" lzma files. Files
compressed with the lzma tools available on Linux can be decompressed
and files can be compressed. An extremely simple lzmago binary is now
provided for testing.

To test it call the following command.

    $ lzmago bigfile

After some time a hopefully much smaller file bigfile.lzma will have
been created. To decompress it use the following commmand.

    $ lzmago -d bigfile.lzma

Be warned at this time the code cannot compete with the lzma binary from
the xz tools. The algorithms in those tools have been developed over a
long time and are highly optimized. But the lzmago tool happily
decompresses files generated by lzma and lzma has no problems with files
created by lzmago.
